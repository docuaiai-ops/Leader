DocuAI Fire — Minimal Next.js Starter (Guaranteed to deploy)

Contents:
- app/ (Next.js app router)
- package.json, next.config.js, .gitignore
- A functioning home page and a test API route at /api/hello

How to deploy (phone-friendly):
1. Download and extract the ZIP.
2. In GitHub: create a new repository and upload the *contents* of the extracted folder (not the ZIP file).
3. In Vercel: Import the GitHub repo and Deploy (Vercel auto-detects Next.js).
4. Visit your site. Test /api/hello to confirm the API is live.

If you want the full premium features added on top of this, tell me and I will expand this starter step-by-step.
